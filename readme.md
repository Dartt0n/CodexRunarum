# CodexRunarum: Cellular Automata Magic System

CodexRunarum is an innovative magic system for computer games, powered by cellular automata. The system leverages the dynamic and variable nature of cellular automata to create intricate, engaging, and unpredictable gameplay experiences. 

## Overview
This repository contains the Python implementation of the CodexRunarum magic system, as well as a comprehensive paper detailing the design and development process. The paper discusses the fundamental concept of cellular automata, their application in game development, and the advantages and limitations of using cellular automata for creating magic systems in games. 

## Demos
Several demo simulations are available in the `codexrunarum/examples` folder. These demos showcase the unique behaviors and interactions of different elements in the CodexRunarum magic system.
